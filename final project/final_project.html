  <p>	The winner of the 2024 Presidential Election may already be decided. That is, of course, if 2020 Census Data can be used to predict the outcome.</p>
  <p>	Every year, the United States Census collects population and demographic data, including poverty rates by race, age, state, and county. As the 2024 Presidential Election continues to be nearing, such data can be used to predict a potential outcome. While it is unclear who will be the candidate for both major parties, it looks as if it will be a rematch of the 2020 election, Donald Trump v. Joe Biden.</p>
  <p>	Of all the issues American voters have, the economy and poverty have always been among the highest. Democratic voters believe in more government programs to reduce poverty, while Republicans historically believe in limited government involvement in the economy.</p>
  <p>	That being said, poverty rates in America may not have the correlation to vote outcome that you may think.</p>

<p>	In 2020, Ziebach County, South Dakota, was the poorest county in the United States. A small, rural town, Ziebach County is populated by mostly Cheyenne River Sioux Indians. The local hospital lacks basic supplies, and the employment rate is incredibly high. There are not many opportunities in the town. </p>
<p>		However, in 2016, the county’s poverty rate was only 14.4%. In the Presidential Election of that year, Ziebach County voted for Donald Trump. Yet, four years later, after the town’s poverty rate increased by almost 30%, one would assume that voters would want assistance in restoring their economic state. Who won the vote? President Trump.</p>
<p>		It is easy to assume that voters struck down by poverty would want to receive economic help and relief from their government. Yet, out of the ten counties that had the largest increase in poverty, eight of them voted for the Republican candidate, Trump.</p>
<p>		Charles Evans, an American government and history teacher at the High School of American Studies in the Bronx, New York, believes it to be a tad more complicated.  “It is too simplistic to assume that all poor counties want a republican candidate,” Evans says. “These ten counties represented have incredibly small populations. You also have to take into consideration the platforms each candidate ran on.”</p>
<p>		President Trump vowed to boost the economy in rural areas. The “Farm Bill,” which was enacted in 2018, provided almost $900 billion dollars in aid for American farmers. A survey conducted by The Progressive Farmer placed farmer support for Trump at 70% in 2020. So, it makes sense that despite a large increase in poverty, these small counties would continue to support the incumbent.</p>
<p>		On a greater scale, a correlation between a change in income and voting results can still be made. Of the 2,593 counties that voted for President Trump in 2020, almost two-thirds experienced an improvement in the economy in the previous four years. The difference for Biden voting counties is even more drastic. </p>
<p>		“People don’t want to really have to think about politics,” Evans continued. “If they are overall unaffected economically, or affected positively even, they will continue to support the person in power.” This explains why only ⅕ of counties voted for a different political party in 2020, compared to four years prior.</p>
<p>		This works when the economy is thriving. There is one issue, however. The economy is no longer thriving. After seeing an overall decrease of poverty percentages in America during President Trump’s term, because of reasons such as COVID-19, poverty rates are only increasing under President Biden. Biden’s approval rating, as recorded by Reuters, is only 42%. At the moment, the majority of Americans are unhappy with the current man in office.</p>

<p>		“We may see something similar to what happened in 2016, again,” Evans said. “Many Americans are growing tired of the current state of government. Businesses are failing due to policies related to Coronavirus. The people are not happy. Such policies and falters will convince formerly Democratic voters to turn Red.”</p>
<p>		It is not unfair to predict that the increase in poverty rates in America will cause more counties to vote for the challenger. If Trump is in fact the Republican candidate, his popularity and charisma alone may be enough to put the GOP back in office.</p>
<p>		Although high population counties in States such as New York or California are unlikely to be swayed, large cities in swing states such as Pennsylvania, Arizona, Michigan, or even Florida are likely to vote against Biden. </p>
<p>		As the road to the 2024 Presidential Election continues, many issues will be brought to light. Reproductive rights, taxes, gun rights, religious freedoms, among others. However, this election will be decided by who can convince the American people that they will redirect the economy. The correlation between poverty rates and political support is telling. And, if the current President would like to remain in office, it seems that he must help turn this ship around.</p>
